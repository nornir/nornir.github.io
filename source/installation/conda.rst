Conda Installation
==================

The simplest way to deploy Nornir is with Anaconda.  

Import a .yaml file below to create a new conda environment.  Once the environment is created the `nornir-build` command should be available.  Use `python -m pyre` to launch pyre.

*Note:* you will still need to have the :ref:`third party tools <third-party-tools>` installed in your path to use some features of nornir-build.
